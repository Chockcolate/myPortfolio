                <p class="lora-body">
                    I grew up surrounded by the love of a supportive family. Traveling from place to place, I've taken countless pictures, always eager to capture every moment of my life.

                <p class="lora-body">
                    On the evening of September 14, 2023, I realized that "pictures" are different from "photographs." I picked up a Nikon D5500 camera, went to a park in my neighborhood, and took my first photograph. With the crisp sound of the shutter, my story began...

                <p class="lora-body">
                    Soon after, I received my first drone and started experimenting with drone photography. I was also assigned a few projects by my secondary school, Chung Ling High School, and that's when I knew my art was being recognized.

                <p class="lora-body">
                    In addition to my passion for photography, my leadership skills, adaptability, efficiency in task completion, excellent time management, and strong social skills have greatly benefited me throughout my secondary school years. As the Vice President of the Board of Monitors, I was responsible for devising new ideas to streamline the monitors' job scopes and contribute to the school community. I successfully led various activities, including the board chart, offense book, inspirational training camp, and registration processes, all aimed at improving our school environment.

                <p class="lora-body">
                    As the President of the Graduation Magazine, I led eight diverse groups ranging from photography and videography to arts and book editing, requiring a broad knowledge across these fields. I was also the Organizing Chairman of the 2022 Appreciation Dinner, receiving commendations from numerous teachers for the event's smooth flow, fun environment, and creative ideas. Additionally, I served as the director, drone controller, videographer, and editor of our graduation music video, showcasing my ability to handle multiple roles effectively.

                <p class="lora-body">
                    In my role within the Chinese Calligraphy Club, I served as the Organizing Chairman for the 105th Anniversary Calligraphy Club Exhibition, the Co-Curricular Exhibition, and the 2023 Chinese New Year Celebration at Chung Ling High School. Given the small number of members in the Calligraphy Club, I dedicated significant time to training a new batch of juniors to ensure they were well-prepared to succeed me. This involved extensive mentoring and teaching them the skills necessary to host successful activities, ensuring the club's continued growth and success.
